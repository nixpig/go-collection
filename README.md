# Go collection

Various bits 'n' pieces I've built while learning to program in Go. Any feedback in issues would be greatly appreciated!

## Data structures and algorithms

- [Insertion sort](data-structures-algorithms/insertion_sort)
- [Binary search](data-structures-algorithms/binary_search)
- [Linked lists](data-structures-algorithms/linked-lists)
- [Linked lists queue](data-structures-algorithms/linked-list-queue)
- [Stack (array)](data-structures-algorithms/array-stack)
- [Queue (array list)](data-structures-algorithms/array-queue)
- [Ring buffer (array)](data-structures-algorithms/ring-buffer)
- [Binary search tree](data-structures-algorithms/binary-search-tree)
- [Trie](data-structures-algorithms/trie)
- [Priority queue (heap)](data-structures-algorithms/heap)

## Design patterns

- [Dependency injection](design-patterns/dependency-injection)
